                    <p>On 149th street between 95th and 97th Avenue in Jamaica, N.Y., a silver Nissan Altima at least a decade old lies abandoned on a curb outside an industrial building.</p>
                    <p>There are no plates, no registration and the front-left tire is missing with a thin piece of plywood wedged underneath the driver’s door to keep the rest of the vehicle’s body off of the pavement.</p>
                    <p>This particular car, which sports a New York Department of Sanitation neon orange tag for removal, represents just one of the thousands of vehicles that are left abandoned and broken on the side of Queens streets each year.</p>
                    <p>A nuisance to residents, these junked automobiles are called “derelict vehicles.” Queens Community Board 12 representing Jamaica, Hollis and St. Albans has experienced an influx in derelict vehicle complaints more than any other community district across all five boroughs.</p>

                    ! function() {
                        "use strict";
                        window.addEventListener("message", function(a) {
                            if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                                for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                                    var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                                    t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                                }
                        })
                    }();
                    </script>
                    <p>Unfortunately, these derelict vehicles left on public streets and sidewalks lead to issues like less parking for Jamaica residents who happen to live in a crowded community with a population of 225,000 across 9.6 square miles (23,533 people per square mile), per the 2010 Census (h/t NYC.gov Community District Profiles)</p>
                    <p>Other problems such as street cleanliness also arise, as Queens Community Board 12 has seen a 12.8% drop in the past year in streets rated acceptably clean by the Department of Sanitation, per NYC.gov’s Agency Performing Mapping Report.</p>
                    <p>The good news is that removing derelict vehicles is a straightforward, simple process.</p>
                    <p>Any abandoned vehicle on public property, which includes streets, sidewalks, highway embankments and public alleys, can be reported to New York City 311.</p>
                    <p>“The New York Department of Sanitation will review the complaint and determine whether the vehicle in question meets its criteria to be classified as derelict,” according to an emailed statement by the Department of Sanitation’s press office.</p>
                    <p>“The year of the car determines the number of criteria that must be met. Once tagged, it will be removed by the city’s vendor within three business days.”</p>
                    <p>Abandoned vehicles with a license plate are instead referred to the Police Department and local precinct. The Department of Sanitation did not elaborate on the additional criteria used to determine the legitimacy of a derelict vehicle complaint.</p>
                    <p>Removing junked vehicles has become a streamlined process, but the complaints in Queens Community Board 12 have continued to increase since 2014.</p>

                                for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                                    var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                                    t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                                }

                    }();
                    </script>
                    <p>And since derelict vehicles have no license plates, it’s hard for the Department of Sanitation or the NYPD to track owner information.</p>
                    <p>“We have no idea where they are coming from,” said Queens Community Board 12 District Manager Yvonne Reddick. “They get taken away today and tomorrow another one is out there in the same spot.”</p>
                    <p>The Department of Sanitation declined to comment when asked about the rising complaints and presence of derelict vehicles in Queens Community Board 12.</p>
